  I'm Isaiah, a 2nd year mathematics PhD student at the [University of Nebraska - Lincoln](https://math.unl.edu/), advised by Mark Walker. My research interests lie (broadly speaking) in commutative algebra. While I was an M.S. student at [Fresno State](https://csm.fresnostate.edu/math/index.html), I worked on Khovanov homology and algebraic knot invariants under the supervision of Carmen Caprau.
